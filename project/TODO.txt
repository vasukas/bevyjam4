MVP goals (not neccessary in that order):

+ level editor;
+ player can walk in the level;

+ enemies standing and shooting (slow projectiles, periodic);
+ player has 2-3 HP, no healing

- barrels-o-fire
    + entity & states
    + level editor
    + graphics (normal)
    - on fire
        - particle logic
        - particle graphics
    - explosions
        - particle logic
        - particle graphics
        - damage & physical impulse

- gun: fire

- gun: gravity
    - pull barrels
    - rotate barrels (graphically)

- add guns to F1 help & explain how they work?

+ enemy overload
+ improve particles: many graphical entities, one physical entity

+ level progression (via elevators)

- add game over screen (fade to black)

- graphical bugs
    + is procedural material stutter present on the web too? prob should fix that
        it was much, much worse
    - sometimes elevator lamp doesn't change color
    - overload labels are visible on death screen




Extra goals:

- improve gameplay
    - on-screen indicator for being hit
    - breakable pipes with water and electric panels
    - slowdown effect
    - "Application is not responding. .... Well done!" message

- extra gameplay
    - final boss (respawning barrels; speed challenge)

- improve visuals
    - level decorations
    - sounds
    - real graphics for projectiles and particles
    - lightning/explosion effect (for overload, at least)

- nice visuals
    - rework jimbo anims
    - intro and outro
    - backgrounds (scrolling stars, partially hidden by the ship)
    - poster image, for itch page and menu background

- technical
    - fix overload render coordinates (text and rect are misaligned relative to each other)
    - particle count multiplier (for increasing performance)




Release

- make itch.io page
    disable "Automatically start on page load" for sound to work
    maybe use other screen size than 1280x720? this will require changes in code!

- credit all used libraries and assets

+ add list of all controls (on F1 key; mention that when the game starts)

- check all TODOs




Improvements (post-release)

- fix bugs
    - elevator light position is invalid (and God knows where)
    - elevator light looks weird on exit cable

- show controls & objectives in-world instead of separate menu

- add keybinds;

- add camera room tracking (importance points, bounds, whatever), so it doesn't just follow the player

- add import/export buttons for settings in web

- (maybe) try optimized wasm builds (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#optimizing)
    (initial attempt: size isn't that much smaller, but build times are HUGE)




Post-release

- (hard) fix audio stutter in wasm
- (hard) fix occasional stuttering in browser

- add webgpu build (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#webgl2-and-webgpu)
    (apparently isn't enabled by default on Linux in neither Firefox nor Chrome)
- figure out why wrong GPU is detected (RX 200 in Firefox/Linux/webgl2, Chromium works fine)

- lots of "Animation interpolation Step is not supported, will use linear" etcetera
  (for now disabled log message, see main.rs)
  (seems to be caused by animation sampling in GLTF; but without it models can't be loaded by bevy)
