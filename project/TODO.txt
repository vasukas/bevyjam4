MVP

- ...

- don't forget to change Scores::level and reset it when game is finished


MVP goals (not neccessary in that order):
* level with a couple of rooms/corridors;
* player can walk in the level;
- enemies standing and shooting (slow projectiles, periodic);
- player can pick up "shield gens" (medkits);
- player can pick up, carry and throw batteries and barrels;
- there are breakable pipes with water and electric panels;
- barrels with oil, water and explosives;
- enemies can be hit with knockback;
- water, electricity, oil, fire: all interacting with each other;
- liquids spread;
- sounds for all that;
- (particle) effects for all that;
- enemy overloading.

Extra goals:
- level progression;
- slowdown effects;
- "Application is not responding. .... Well done!" message.




Critical bugs

...




Release

- make itch.io page, list all used libraries and assets
    disable "Automatically start on page load" for sound to work

- check all TODOs




Improvements

- add camera room tracking (importance points, bounds, whatever), so it doesn't just follow the player

- add import/export buttons for settings in web

- (maybe) try optimized wasm builds (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#optimizing)
    (initial attempt: size isn't that much smaller, but build times are HUGE)




Post-release

- (hard) fix audio stutter in wasm
- (hard) fix occasional stuttering in browser
- add webgpu build (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#webgl2-and-webgpu)
    (apparently isn't enabled by default on Linux in neither Firefox nor Chrome)
- figure out why wrong GPU is detected (RX 200 in Firefox/Linux/webgl2, Chromium works fine)
