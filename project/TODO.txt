Base

(done before jam, to clear some technical/organisational issues)

+ wasm build
+ cookies (which also should work on desktop)
+ check where logs are in browser (in dev console, where else)

+ get audio to work in wasm at all

- (hard) fix audio stutter in wasm
    - find a way to reliable trigger it

+ fullscreen toggle (in browser)




Critical bugs

(must be fixed)

MVP

(must be done)

Improvements

(would be nice to do, not that important)

- (hard) fix occasional stuttering in browser

- add import/export buttons for settings in web

- add webgpu build (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#webgl2-and-webgpu)
    (apparently isn't enabled by default on Linux in neither Firefox nor Chrome)

...




Release

(must be done, but only right before submitting the entry)

- make itch.io page, list all used libraries and assets
    disable "Automatically start on page load" for sound to work

- check all TODOs

- (maybe) try optimized wasm builds (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#optimizing)
    (initial attempt: size isn't that much smaller, but build times are HUGE)

...




Post-release

(would be nice to do, but ONLY if any time left)

- figure out why wrong GPU is detected (RX 200 in Firefox/Linux/webgl2, Chromium works fine)

...
