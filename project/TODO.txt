MVP goals (not neccessary in that order):

+ level editor;
+ player can walk in the level;

+ enemies standing and shooting (slow projectiles, periodic);
+ player has 2-3 HP, no healing

+ gun: fire

+ enemy overload
+ improve particles: many graphical entities, one physical entity

+ level progression (via elevators)
+ add game over screen (fade to black)

+ barrels-o-fire

+ gun: gravity
    + pull barrels
    - rotate barrels (graphically)

+ tweak overload so game is actually playable

+ make itch.io page
    disable "Automatically start on page load" for sound to work
    maybe use other screen size than 1280x720? this will require changes in main.rs!

+ credit all used libraries

+ rework first level into proper tutorial & explain (to player) how guns work
+ flavor text!
    + intro and outro

? gameplay kind of isn't there
+ minor bugs/stuff
    / fix pull: put timer on activating it, not disabling! (or don't "fix" that?)
    + player fire just appears, doesn't look good
    / player fire spawns outside of walls if standing too close to them
    + improve visibility of fire particles produced by exploding barrels
    ? improve visibility in general
    + remove halt when using kick (animation: replace with roundhouse jump)
    / maybe? remove push-away from pull
    + limit fire projectile lifetime
    / exit elevator still stays red sometimes

/ add decorations to
    + connector (some vertpipe2 in corner with other pipes)
    + loading bay
    - storage (more!)

- add more levels
    + storage
    + process
    O tunnels
    - engine
    + security/bridge

+ add final boss (respawning barrels; speed challenge)
    + boss creature
    / boss attacks
    + barrel conveyor

- release
    + poster for itch page
    - add screenshots to itch page
    + add native builds

+ overload visible after player's death (would be nice to fade it, but oh well)
+ boss overload: one at a time
/ conveyors don't work on enemies
/ final boss insta-overloads after one "pillar" is

/ left-click & walk carries through almost everything

/ bevy bug:
thread 'main' panicked at 'error[B0003]: Could not insert a bundle (of type `bevy_pbr::light::VisiblePointLights`) for entity 2280v5 because it doesn't exist in this World.', /home/vasukas/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/bevy_ecs-0.12.1/src/system/commands/mod.rs:1022:13



Extra goals:

/ more stuff
    - add even more levels
    - more level graphics (decorations)
        + scorchmarks
        - different walls & floors
        - other stuff

/ web bugs
    / no shadows on most lights
    / does material hack actually work? seems only partially
    / huge delayed lag first time starting first level

/ potential gameplay improvements
    - particles kinda obstruct vision too much
        - add gizmo-based helpers?
    - (maybe) make weapons directional (cursor-based)?

/ more stuff
    - gather time statistics and display them to player

/ very extra
    + background: scrolling stars, partially hidden by the ship
    + lightning-explosion effect (for overload, at least)
    - slowdown effect
    - "Application is not responding. .... Well done!" message




Improvements (post-release)

- (maybe) camera shake from explosions
- make barrels rotate when pulled

- check all TODOs

- improve graphics
    - on-screen indicator for being hit
    - breakable pipes with water and electric panels

- improve visuals
    / (web performance is too bad for this) sounds
    - real graphics for projectiles and particles

- nice visuals
    - rework jimbo anims

- technical
    - fix overload render coordinates (text and rect are misaligned relative to each other)
    - particle count multiplier (for increasing performance)

- graphical bugs
    - sometimes elevator lamp doesn't change color
    - overload labels are visible on death screen

- fix bugs
    - elevator light position is invalid (and God knows where)
    - elevator light looks weird on exit cable

- show controls & objectives in-world instead of separate menu

- add keybinds;

- add camera room tracking (importance points, bounds, whatever), so it doesn't just follow the player

- add import/export buttons for settings in web

- (maybe) try optimized wasm builds (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#optimizing)
    (initial attempt: size isn't that much smaller, but build times are HUGE)




Post-release

- (hard) fix audio stutter in wasm
- (hard) fix occasional stuttering in browser

- add webgpu build (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#webgl2-and-webgpu)
    (apparently isn't enabled by default on Linux in neither Firefox nor Chrome)
- figure out why wrong GPU is detected (RX 200 in Firefox/Linux/webgl2, Chromium works fine)

- lots of "Animation interpolation Step is not supported, will use linear" etcetera
  (for now disabled log message, see main.rs)
  (seems to be caused by animation sampling in GLTF; but without it models can't be loaded by bevy)
