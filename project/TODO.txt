MVP goals (not neccessary in that order):

+ level editor;
* player can walk in the level;
- enemies standing and shooting (slow projectiles, periodic);
- player can pick up "shield gens" (medkits);
- player can pick up, carry and throw batteries and barrels;

- enemies can be hit with knockback;
- enemy overloading;

- there are breakable pipes with water and electric panels;
- barrels with oil, water and explosives;
- water, electricity, oil, fire: all interacting with each other;
- liquids spread;

- sounds for all that;
- (particle) effects for all that;

- level with a couple of rooms/corridors;
- actual graphics (be it 2D or 3D).




Extra goals:

- level progression (via elevators);
- slowdown effects;
- "Application is not responding. .... Well done!" message;
- harder challenges (i.e. walls can burst from too much explosions);
- intro and outro;
    (don't forget to reset Scores::level when game is finished)
- final boss;
- backgrounds (scrolling stars, partially hidden by the ship);
- level decorations;
- poster image, for itch page and menu background.




Bugs

- lots of "Animation interpolation CubicSpline is not supported, will use linear" etcetera
  (for now disabled log message, see main.rs)




Release

- make itch.io page
    disable "Automatically start on page load" for sound to work
- credit all used libraries and assets

- make window take whole page

- add list of all controls (on F1 key; mention that when the game starts)

- check all TODOs




Improvements

- add keybinds;

- add camera room tracking (importance points, bounds, whatever), so it doesn't just follow the player

- add import/export buttons for settings in web

- (maybe) try optimized wasm builds (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#optimizing)
    (initial attempt: size isn't that much smaller, but build times are HUGE)




Post-release

- (hard) fix audio stutter in wasm
- (hard) fix occasional stuttering in browser
- add webgpu build (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#webgl2-and-webgpu)
    (apparently isn't enabled by default on Linux in neither Firefox nor Chrome)
- figure out why wrong GPU is detected (RX 200 in Firefox/Linux/webgl2, Chromium works fine)
