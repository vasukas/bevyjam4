MVP goals (not neccessary in that order):

+ level editor;
+ player can walk in the level;

+ enemies standing and shooting (slow projectiles, periodic);
+ player has 2-3 HP, no healing

- fix
    + enemy rate of fire
    - no impact particles
    - enemy line-of-sight check
    + adjust health & damage & overload for high rate of fire
    - player hit & death animations don't play (they are activated! what the hell!)

- barrels
- gun: fire
- gun: gravity

- fire effect
- enemy overload

- rework jimbo anims
- level progression (via elevators)




Extra goals:

- breakable pipes with water and electric panels
- level decorations

- sounds
- real graphics for projectiles and particles

- slowdown effect
- "Application is not responding. .... Well done!" message

- intro and outro
- final boss (respawning barrels; speed challenge)
    (don't forget to reset Scores::level when game is finished)

- backgrounds (scrolling stars, partially hidden by the ship)
- poster image, for itch page and menu background

- particle count multiplier (for increasing performance)




Bugs

...




Release

- make itch.io page
    disable "Automatically start on page load" for sound to work
- credit all used libraries and assets

- make window take whole page

+ add list of all controls (on F1 key; mention that when the game starts)

- check all TODOs




Improvements (post-release)

- show controls & objectives in-world instead of separate menu

- add keybinds;

- add camera room tracking (importance points, bounds, whatever), so it doesn't just follow the player

- add import/export buttons for settings in web

- (maybe) try optimized wasm builds (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#optimizing)
    (initial attempt: size isn't that much smaller, but build times are HUGE)




Post-release

- (hard) fix audio stutter in wasm
- (hard) fix occasional stuttering in browser

- add webgpu build (see https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/latest/examples#webgl2-and-webgpu)
    (apparently isn't enabled by default on Linux in neither Firefox nor Chrome)
- figure out why wrong GPU is detected (RX 200 in Firefox/Linux/webgl2, Chromium works fine)

- lots of "Animation interpolation Step is not supported, will use linear" etcetera
  (for now disabled log message, see main.rs)
  (seems to be caused by animation sampling in GLTF; but without it models can't be loaded by bevy)
